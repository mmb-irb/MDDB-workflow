# This tool allows you to set the chain of all atoms in a selection
# This is powered by VMD and thus the selection lenguage must be the VMD's

# 1 - Input pdb filename
# 2 - Atom selection
# 3 - Chain letter
# 4 - Output pdb filename (Optional. Input filename by default)
# e.g. python chainer.py example.pdb 'resname POPS' 'M'

# This arguments are passed when the script is called
# The input pdb filename

# The new chain letter
