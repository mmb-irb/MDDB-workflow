# LORE
# This test was originaly intended to use a RMSD jump cutoff based on number of atoms and timestep
# However, after a deep study, it was observed that simulations with similar features may show very different RMSD jumps
# For this reason now we comptue RMSD jumps along the whole trajectory and check that the biggest jump is not an outlier
# The outlier is defined according to how many times the standard deviation far from the mean is a value

# Look for sudden raises of RMSd values from one frame to another
# To do so, we check the RMSD of every frame using its previous frame as reference
# This was allowed thanks to people from MDtraj https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj/issues/1966
