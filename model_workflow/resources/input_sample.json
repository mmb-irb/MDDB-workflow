    "description": "1\u00b5s simulation trajectory (500 frames collected with a stride of 2ns) of the spike glycoprotein head based on the structure released on the SwissModel website to which 18 N-glycans were added on each subunit based on the experimentally determined glycomic profile (PDB numbering = 1-1287 subunit A and N-glycans covalently attached; 1288-2571 subunit B and N-glycans covalently attached; 2572-3857 subunit C and N-glycans covalently attached). ACE2 was superimposed to on spike subunit, while 6 N-glycans were added based on the experimentally determined glycomic profile (PDB numbering heparin chains 3858 - 4510). The C- and N-peptide termini of each subunit are capped with amide and acetyl groups, respectively. The simulation was carried out using the Amber ff14SB force field and GLYCAM_06j for the protein and N-glycans/heparin, respectively. The periodic-cubic water box was solvated with TIP3P water molecules. The system was neutralized with NaCl to attain an ionic concentration of 0.15M. The simulations were conducted at 310 K in the NPT ensemble",
