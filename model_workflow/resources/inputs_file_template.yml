# Set the source pdb ids of the trajectory structure
# Additional data from the pdb is harvested by the loader while uploading to the database
# This data is displayed in the overview page
#
# Example:
#
# pdb_ids:
#   - 6ACS
#   - 6M0J

pdb_ids:

# Set which reference sequences must be used in order to map residues in the structure of the simulation
# UniProt accession ids are accepted
# Forced references may be not provided or just cover the structure partially
# Then a blast will be run for each orphan chain sequence
# In addition, UniProt accession ids may be guessed from the PDB ids, when provided
# Forced references may be provided as a list
# In this scenario UniProt sequences are aligned to chain sequences to guess which UniProt belongs to each chain
# Forced references may be provided as a dictionary
# Tthen the user specifies which reference belongs to each chain
# Use the "noref" flag to mark a chain as "no referable" (e.g. antibodies, synthetic constructs)
#

# forced_references:
#   - Q9BYF1
#   - P0DTC2
#
# forced_references:
#   A: Q9BYF1
#   B: P0DTC2
#   C: noref

forced_references:

# Set ligands in the simulation
# The workflow identifies ligands by their pubchem accession
# If a pubchem accession is passed then it is used
# Otherwise, the pubchem accession is found using other database accessions
# Each ligand must have at least one of the following attributes:
#   - pubchem: the PubChem accession
#   - drugbank: the DrugBank accession
#   - chembl: the ChEMBL accession
# Optionally, a list of vmd selections may be provided to force the mapping

# ANALYSIS PARAMETERS
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# These fields have an impact in the analysis workflow.


# Set which are the interesting interactions to be analyzed
# A bunch of interaction-specific analyses will be run for each interaction and displayed in the web client
#
# Interactions are defined by the 'agents' which are meant to interact pairwise
# An 'agent' may be anything, even a group of unrelated molecules
# The only condition is that agents must be defined by residues
# Residues of different agents which are close enought will be considered as interface residues
# These residues will be the ones considered in interface analyses
# If no interface residues are found then the interaction is considered not valid and the user is warned
#
# Interactions are uploaded to the database as part of the project metadata and as an independent analysis
# Project metadata includes the interaction name, agents name and agent residues selections (vmd syntax)
# Analysis data includes also every agent residue indices (both the whole agent and the interface only)
#
# Each interaction has the following attributes:
#    - name: a string tag used to relate interaction analyses data with their corresponding residues.
#     In addition, the name is used to label the corresponding analyses in the web client
#    - agent_1: the name of the first agent in the interaction, which is used to label in the client
#    - selection_1: the VMD selection of the first agent in the interaction
#    - agent_2: the name of the second agent in the interaction, which is used to label in the client
#    - selection_2: the VMD selection of the second agent in the interaction
#
# VMD atom selection language:
# https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/vmd-1.3/ug/node132.html
#
# Example:
#
# interactions:
#   - name: protein-ligand interaction
#     agent_1: protein
#     selection_1: not resname lig
#     agent_2: ligand
#     selection_2: resname lig
#   - name: domain-domain interaction
#     agent_1: domain 1
#     selection_1: resid 2 to 291
#     agent_2: domain 2
#     selection_2: resid 2 to 291

interactions:

# Set those residues which are under periodic boundary conditions (PBC)
# These residues are excluded from the imaging centering and fitting
# These residues are excluded in the follwoing analyses:
#    - RMSD: Sudden jumps in PBC residues result in non-sense high peaks
#    - RMSD per residue: Sudden jumps in PBC residues result in non-sense high peaks
#    - RMSD pairwise: Sudden jumps in PBC residues result in non-sense high peaks
#    - TM score: Sudden jumps in PBC residues result in non-sense high peaks
#    - RGYR: Sudden jumps in PBC residues result in non-sense high changes
#    - RMSF: Sudden jumps in PBC residues result in non-sense high peaks
#    - PCA: Sudden jumps make not sense in PCA and they eclipse non-PBC movements
#    - SASA: Residues close to the boundary will be considered exposed to solvent while they may be not
#    - Pockets: Residues close to the boundary may be considered to have pockets while they have not <span style="color:red">(DANI: Esto en realidad no se puede hacer porque fpocket no permite "descartar" átomos de manera inteligente. Si quitas átomos para que no encuentre pockets en ellos entonces pueden aparecer pockets en los sitios que están ocupados por estos átomos. De momento descartamos el análisis entero cuando hay algo en PBC y listo)<span />
#    - Clusters: Since Clustering is RMSD-based it has the same limitations
#
# If this field is set to 'auto' then PBC residues are set automatically
# Solvent, counter ions and membrane lipids are selected in this cases
# Note that these are the most tipical residues under periodic boundary conditions
#
# This field is also useful for those scenarions with several protein or nucleic acid molecules floating around
# In this situation you can not image and fit all molecules
# You must focus in one molecule and let the others stay in periodic boundary conditions
#
# These residues are defined using VMD selection lenguage.
#
# VMD atom selection language:

#
# Example
#
# pbc_selection: water or ions

pbc_selection: auto

# REPRESENTATION PARAMETERS
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These fields have an impact in the display of the simulation once in the web client


# Set optional custom chain names which may be longer than a single letter
# This names are used to label chains in the web client
#
# chainnames:
#   A: Protein
#   B: Ligand

chainnames:

# Set those elements which must be considered membrane
# These elements will be representated in the web client with a specific pattern:
# - Licorice
# - Purple color
# - Low opacity
#
# To define a membrane it is required a name and a selection in VMD selection lenguage
#
# VMD atom selection language:
# https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/vmd-1.3/ug/node132.html
#
# LORE
# This field is the predecessor of the 'pbc_selection' field
# Now it is deprecated but we are still maintaining it
# One day this information may be useful and we already have it in the database.
#
# DANI: Aunque este campo ya no debería tener efecto en el workflow sigue teniendo uno:
# DANI: El análisis de pockets no corre si hay membranas
#
# Example:
#
# membranes:
#   - name: Cell membrane
#     selection: chain M

membranes:

# The web client sets some default representations (molecular viewer configurations)
# They highlight important features in the structure according to the topology reference or interactions
# In addition, you may set extra customized representations which are interesting for you
# These representations will be available in the web client
# WARNING: Make sure whatever you want to represent is not already represented by default or it will be duplicated
#
# Example:
#
# customs:
#   - name: A custom view focusing on an interesting residue
#     representations:
#       - name: The very interesing residue
#         selection: VIR
#         type: ball+stick
#         color: element
#       - name: The resting boring molecule
#         selection: not VIR
#         type: cartoon
#         color: chainid

customs:

# Set a specific starting orientation for the web client viewer
# Normally this is done once the simulation has been uploaded since there is no easy way to get the orientation before.

# INPUT FILES
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Directories for every MD in the project
# Input file paths for topology, trajectory and structure
# Note that all these values may be specified thorugh command line as well

# Each project may contain several Molecular Dynamics (MD)
# Each MD is to be stored in an independent folder when running the workflow
# Each MD must have a different name, which will be used also to assign directories in the workflow
#
# MDs may include additional metadata to overwrite the project metadata for a specific case
#
# Example:
#
# mds:
#   - name: replica 310 K
#     mdir: replica_1
#     temp: 310
#   - name: replica 311 K
#     mdir: replica_2
#     temp: 311

mds:

# Also the reference MD is to be defined by providing the index of the MDs list
# If there is not an MD which is more important than others then simply set the first MD (0) as the reference
#
# Example:
#
# mdref: 0

mdref:

# Input topology, trajectroy and structure files
#
# LORE
# These files have been passed to the workflow through command line traditionally
# Now the inputs file also provides this option
